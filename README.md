This analysis explores the relationship between ocean climate variables and marine biodiversity across a range of global ocean locations. The dataset spans 9 years and contains information on key ocean climate indicators, such as Sea Surface Temperature (SST), pH level, and the occurrence of marine heatwaves. Additionally, it provides insights into coral bleaching severity and the number of marine species observed at various locations.

The primary aim of this analysis is to understand how changes in ocean conditions—such as rising temperatures and acidification — affect marine biodiversity. Through a series of visualizations, we investigate trends over time, geographical variations, and the potential impact of marine heatwaves and bleaching events on marine species diversity. This analysis is particularly relevant in the context of climate change, which is increasingly influencing ocean health and the biodiversity within.
